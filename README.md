# Electric-Vehicle-Population-Power-BI Project
**Motivation of the project: **
This is project for my Data Visualization class. Electric vehicles population sourced from Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) to gain insights into U.S. EV market and its dynamics. Assumption is made that this project will help a TATA motors (motor manufacturing company in India) to introduce EV in the US market starting with Washington state.

**Questions answered by the Power BI Visualization**
1. How is the distribution of Electric Vehicles by state or county?
   - Urban areas like Seattle and the counties surrounding it has dense electric vehicle population count.
   - Shows top 20 counties with the highest number of electric vehicles (EVs).
   - Counties that have higher urbanization and better infrastructure are likely to have greater EV adoption.
     
2. How is the distribution of Electric Range among on Make, Models and Electric Vehicle Types?
  - Tesla models lead in terms of maximum electric range, with the Model S having the highest range at 337 miles, followed by the Model 3, Model X, and Model Y.
  - Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) have longer ranges compared to Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
   
3. What is the trend of Electric Vehicle adoption over the years?
   - The line graph shows a upward trajectory in total EV adoption from 2017 to 2024.
   - There is a noticeable rise in BEV registration while PHEVs registration is steady throughout 2017 to 2024.

**Future Scope **
Datasets used in this project have potential to answer more questions related to Electric Vehicles. For instance, “Base MSRP” and “Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility” attributes which were discarded after forming the questions can be used to answer questions related to how situation of pricing by Manufacturer is and CAFV eligibility. Additionally, this dataset is real world dataset, we could combine this dataset with EV population of all the states in the USA to analyze the condition of Electric Vehicles of all the states in the USA for more comprehensive analysis.
